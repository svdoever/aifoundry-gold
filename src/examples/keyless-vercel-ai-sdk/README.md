# Keyless Azure AI Foundry Streaming Example

This example demonstrates how to use Azure AI Foundry with keyless authentication and streaming support. It provides a modern React application with real-time chat capabilities using the same Azure AI Foundry endpoint as the HTML example.

## Features

- **Keyless Authentication**: Uses Azure MSAL for browser-based authentication without API keys
- **Azure AI Foundry Integration**: Uses the correct `.services.ai.azure.com/models` endpoint
- **Streaming Support**: Real-time streaming of AI responses for better user experience
- **Reusable Configuration**: Generic configuration component that can be used across multiple examples
- **TypeScript & CSS Modules**: Modern development stack with type safety and scoped styles
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface that works on all devices

## Configuration

The application uses local storage to persist configuration across browser sessions. All settings can be configured through the UI or passed as URL parameters.

### Local Storage Keys

The application uses the same local storage keys as the original HTML example (`aifoundry-keyless.html`) for consistency:

- `aifoundry:clientId` - Azure App Registration Client ID
- `aifoundry:tenantId` - Azure Tenant ID  
- `aifoundry:resourceName` - Azure AI Foundry resource name
- `aifoundry:deploymentName` - Model deployment name (e.g., gpt-4o, gpt-35-turbo)
- `aifoundry:redirectUri` - Single-page application redirect URI

### Configuration

Configuration values are loaded from **Local Storage**.

### Azure App Registration Setup

The configuration UI provides several helpful features for Azure setup:

#### Redirect URI Management
- **Auto-detection**: The current page URL is automatically detected as the default redirect URI
- **Copy to Clipboard**: Click the ðŸ“‹ button to copy the redirect URI for easy pasting into Azure Portal
- **Validation**: The redirect URI must be registered as a **Single-page application** redirect URI in Azure

#### Azure Portal Integration
- **Direct Link**: When a Client ID is entered, a direct link to the Azure App Registration Authentication page is generated
- **Quick Access**: Click "ðŸ”— Open Azure Portal App Registration" to jump directly to the correct configuration page
- **Disabled State**: The link is disabled until a valid Client ID is provided

### Storage Management

The configuration UI provides storage management options:

- **Save to Local Storage**: Persists all configuration values for future sessions (requires all fields to be filled)
- **Clear Local Storage**: Removes all stored configuration values
- **Validation**: Visual feedback shows success/error messages for storage operations

## Architecture

### Components

- **AIFoundryConfig**: Reusable configuration UI component
- **AIFoundryConfigUtils**: Utility functions for configuration management
- **AzureProvider**: Custom Azure AI Foundry provider that implements streaming chat completions
- **KeylessVercelAISDK**: Main example component

### Tech Stack

- React 19
- TypeScript
- CSS Modules
- Vite 7
- Azure MSAL Browser

## Authentication Flow

1. Configuration is loaded from URL parameters or local storage
2. When sending a message, MSAL attempts silent token acquisition
3. If silent acquisition fails, a popup window opens for interactive login
4. The acquired token is used as a Bearer token in the Authorization header
5. Streaming responses are processed and displayed in real-time

## Development

The example is built as a separate Vite entry point (`keyless-vercel-ai-sdk.html`) and can be accessed directly during development at:

```
http://localhost:5173/keyless-vercel-ai-sdk.html
```

## Benefits over Plain HTML

- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support for better development experience
- **Component Reusability**: Configuration component can be reused in other examples
- **Modern Development**: Hot reload, CSS modules, and modern React patterns
- **Better UX**: Real-time streaming with proper loading states and error handling
- **Maintainability**: Organized code structure with clear separation of concerns
- **Consistent API**: Uses the same Azure AI Foundry endpoint as the HTML example
