Code is either plain HTML, Javascript + CSS in a single file, or a React page just like the homepage.
We use the following tech stack:
- Vite 7
- React 19
- TypeScript
- CSS Modules

Examples are stored in the folder `src/examples`.

Generic components that can be reused should be stored in `src/components`.
